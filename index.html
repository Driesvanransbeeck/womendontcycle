							<h2>A story from Brussels to Tokyo</h2>
							<p>Our <a href="https://roadtotherisingsun.be/" target="_blank">Road To The Rising Sun</a> started in Brussels in February 2019 and ended Tokyo in December 2019. During this journey of 11 months, we crossed 21 countries and cycled about 13.500km. More importantly, we had the chance to meet, talk and learn from so many people!</p>

							<h2>Meeting extraordinary women cyclists</h2>
							<p>Some interviews were planned beforehand, but most encounters were spontaneous. It was fantastic that most women also introduced us to their cycling friends and communities. And more than that, they invited us to share a meal, to cycle with them and, even once, to go a beautiful wedding!</p>

							<h2>Sharing our passion for slow travel</h2>
							<p>This journey made us look at the world in a totally different way. That's why we're so much looking forward to meeting and sharing with you at a screening!<br><br>It inspired us so much that we want other people to experience the magic of slow travel too! In 2020, we set up <a href="https://welcometomygarden.org/" target="_blank">Welcome To My Garden</a>. As we learnt first-hand that it takes long evenings and many websites to plan and prepare a trip, we're now in the process of building Slowby, a new self-planning tool for slow travels. More coming soon!</p>
