						<h2>About Manon Brulard</h2>
						<p>Women Don't Cycle was filmed by Manon when she left with Dries on a <a href="https://roadtotherisingsun.be/" target="_blank">long journey from Brussels to Tokyo</a>  in 2019. During this bicycle tour of 11 months, they crossed 21 countries and cycled about 13.500km. More importantly, they had the chance to meet, talk and learn from so many people!</p>
						<p>Some interviews were planned beforehand, but most encounters were spontaneous. It was fantastic that most women also introduced them to their cycling friends and communities. And more than that, they invited them to share a meal, to cycle with them and, even once, to go a beautiful wedding!</p>
						<p>This journey made them look at the world in a totally different way. That's also why Manon made a film of it! It inspired them so much that we want other people to experience the magic of slow travel too! In 2020, they launched <a href="https://welcometomygarden.org/" target="_blank">Welcome To My Garden</a>, network of citizens opening up their gardens to slow travellers.</p>
